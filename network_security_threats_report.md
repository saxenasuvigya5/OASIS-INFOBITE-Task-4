# Common Network Security Threats

## 📘 Introduction

With increasing reliance on digital systems and internet-based services, network security has become a crucial aspect of protecting organizational and personal data. This report explores some of the most common network security threats, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, and spoofing, alongside their impacts, real-world examples, and mitigation strategies.

## 🛑 1. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

### 🔍 What It Is:
A DoS attack attempts to make a machine or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic.

### 🎯 How It Works:
Attackers flood a target system with excessive requests, consuming bandwidth, memory, or processing power.

### 💥 Impact:
- Website or server downtime
- Loss of revenue
- Damage to brand reputation

### 🌐 Real-World Example:
In 2016, **Dyn**, a DNS provider, was hit by a massive **DDoS attack** using the **Mirai botnet**, affecting platforms like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit.

### 🛡️ Mitigation:
- Use firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Implement rate-limiting and traffic filtering
- Use anti-DDoS cloud services (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield)

## 🕵️ 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

### 🔍 What It Is:
An attacker secretly intercepts or alters communications between two parties.

### 🎯 How It Works:
Attackers place themselves between the sender and recipient, often using tools like packet sniffers or rogue Wi-Fi networks.

### 💥 Impact:
- Sensitive data theft (credentials, financial info)
- Session hijacking
- Loss of privacy and trust

### 🌐 Real-World Example:
In 2011, **DigiNotar**, a Dutch certificate authority, was hacked. Fake certificates were used in MITM attacks to spy on Iranian citizens.

### 🛡️ Mitigation:
- Use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks
- Implement strong VPNs and secure DNS

## 🎭 3. Spoofing Attacks

### 🔍 What It Is:
Spoofing involves pretending to be a trusted source to gain access or information.

### ⚠️ Types of Spoofing:
- **IP Spoofing**: Falsifying IP address to gain unauthorized access
- **Email Spoofing**: Faking sender address to trick recipients
- **DNS Spoofing**: Redirecting traffic to malicious sites

### 💥 Impact:
- Unauthorized access
- Malware delivery
- Phishing attacks

### 🌐 Real-World Example:
In 2020, spoofed emails impersonating the WHO during COVID-19 were used for phishing and spreading malware.

### 🛡️ Mitigation:
- Use email authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Enable DNSSEC to prevent DNS spoofing
- Educate users about phishing techniques

## 📌 General Preventive Measures

- Regularly update and patch systems
- Use antivirus and anti-malware software
- Conduct security audits and penetration tests
- Educate employees on cybersecurity best practices
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## ✅ Conclusion

Understanding and mitigating network security threats is critical in today’s digital world. DoS, MITM, and spoofing attacks can have devastating effects on organizations and individuals alike. By adopting proactive security measures and staying informed about evolving threats, we can significantly reduce the risks and ensure network safety.
